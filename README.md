### üîë Database Configuration

This project uses **PostgreSQL** as the database, managed in the cloud with [Tembo.io](https://tembo.io/). To run it locally, you will need a security certificate provided by Tembo. In the cloud, the configuration is already managed through the `.env-example` file.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Dependencies

Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Maria-riv/url-shortener
cd url-shortener

# Install dependencies
npm install

```

Set up the `.env` file based on `.env-example` and define the database credentials.

### üöÄ Running Locally

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev

```

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build

```

To start the server in production:

```bash
npm start

```

## üìú Main Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | Installs project dependencies. |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the server in development mode. |
| `npm run build` | Builds the project for production. |
| `npm start` | Starts the server in production mode. |
| `npm run prisma:generate` | Generates the Prisma client. |
| `npm run prisma:deploy` | Applies database migrations. |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a **monolithic architecture based on Next.js**, where both the frontend and backend are integrated into the same application, leveraging Next.js API Routes for URL management.

## üìö Data Model

The data model defined in the `schema.prisma` file describes a single entity called **Url**, which is used to manage shortened URLs. Below are the details of each field in the model:

### **Url** Model

- **id**:
   - **Type:** `Int`
   - **Description:** Unique identifier for each record.
   - **Properties:**
      - `@id`: Defines this field as the primary key.
      - `@default(autoincrement())`: The value is auto-generated and increments with each new record.
- **originalUrl**:
   - **Type:** `String`
   - **Description:** Stores the original URL to be shortened.
- **shortUrl**:
   - **Type:** `String`
   - **Description:** Stores the shortened version of the URL.
   - **Properties:**
      - `@unique`: This field must be unique in the database.
- **expiryDate**:
   - **Type:** `DateTime`
   - **Description:** Date and time when the shortened link expires.
- **clicks**:
   - **Type:** `Int`
   - **Description:** Stores the number of clicks the shortened URL has received.
   - **Properties:**
      - `@default(0)`: The initial value is 0.

## Relational Database Schema

| Field | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| id | Int (PK, auto-increment) |
| originalUrl | String |
| shortUrl | String (unique) |
| expiryDate | DateTime |
| clicks | Int (default: 0) |

# üöÄüíª Technological Decisions and Technical Considerations

The choice of technologies used in this project was based on my personal experience and the specific requirements of the system. Given the limited requirements, adopting an overly complex and unnecessary stack would have been irresponsible, considering that in a real-world environment, economic and infrastructure resources are often constrained.

In this context, a simple solution using **Next.js** was proposed. The advantage of Next.js lies in its ability to manage both the frontend and a lightweight backend within the same framework, making it ideal for deployments in free and resource-limited environments. This allows for the construction of a compact and efficient full-stack application, avoiding the overhead of an overly broad technological ecosystem.

Additionally, **Prisma** was chosen as the ORM because it facilitates database migration and management in an agile and secure manner. Prisma enables robust and scalable handling of requests while maintaining high performance and reducing complexity in data management.

To organize the code and ensure its maintainability and scalability, a design pattern based on **Layered Architecture** was implemented. This approach, similar to the **Service Layer** pattern, clearly separates the business logic, database interaction, and application presentation. This separation simplifies optimization and code maintenance, ensuring that each component fulfills specific responsibilities without unnecessary coupling.
